* SeamlessMD Software Test

This repository is my submission for the seamlessMD software test.

It's a basic flask application that serves the required data in 
minimalist html.

** Run via Docker

It's easiest to the use the docker image. Simply run at a terminal:

=docker run -p 8080:8080 dpbriggs/seamlessmd-website=

Then visit [[http://localhost:8080][http://localhost:8080]].

** Run from source

Install the required dependencies:

=pip install -r requirements.txt=

And run the application (use =python3= for debian based systems):

=python main.py=

Then visit [[http://localhost:8080][http://localhost:8080]].
